# WebApp Console Log Action
An action to capture console logs from a web application and post them as a comment on a pull request.

### Motivation
Even when having a CI/CD pipeline with tests, screenshots and other checks in place, it can occur that small changes or
versions of dependencies can break the application in a way that is not covered by the tests.
This action helps to capture console logs from the web application and post them as a comment on a pull request, so that
issues arise as early as possible - especially when the pull request was opened automatically by a bot like dependabot or renovate.

### Use cases
- Capture console logs from a web application deployed on a server
- Capture console logs from a web application that was built in a previous workflow

### Dependencies
This action uses [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to serve the web application (only when passing `localhost` as input, [see details below](#webapp-url)) and [playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright) to capture the console logs.
Furthermore, thanks to [thollander/actions-comment-pull-request](https://github.com/thollander/actions-comment-pull-request) for the comment functionality.

## Usage
To use this action, include it in your GitHub Actions workflow:

### Example with a freshly built app
```yaml
name: Capture Console Logs

on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  capture-console-logs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Have your web-app built
        run: build stuff or get from other build action

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: your-artifact-name
          path: path-to-app/

      - name: Capture Console Logs
        uses: Primajin/webapp-console-log-action@v1
        with:
          artifact-name: your-artifact-name
          webapp-url: 'http://localhost'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example with an already deployed app
```yaml
name: Capture Console Logs

on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  capture-console-logs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Capture Console Logs
        uses: Primajin/webapp-console-log-action@v1
        with:
          webapp-url: 'https://your-deployed-app.com'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
